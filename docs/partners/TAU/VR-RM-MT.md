### Purpose

_Describe the purpose of this component in 1-2 sentences. Please focus especially on what the component takes as its input, what added value it produces, and what is its output._

This component enables the training and supporting human workers in collaborative tasks   


### Data interfaces

_Describe what kind of input and output data is in use.
Be detailed about the interpretation of your data. 
Instead of writing 'input data from 20 sensors', please specify. 
Add reference to some examples or attachments, if reasonable._

_The provided information is to be the basis to identify opportunities for uniform data models across components._

_The preliminary information is taken from the cross-WP questionnaires from spring 2020. Feel free to modify._

Input and output data (but not user interfaces):


1. INPUT: sensors (USB) and HMD (HDMI/USB) and controller joysticks for Oculus Rift
    - Format:  ...
    - Real-time constraints?
    - Expected data volume? E.g. amount per unit of time, if makes sense
    - ... _other details_
