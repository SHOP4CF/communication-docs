. 

### Data interfaces



Input and output data (but not user interfaces):

INPUT

1. INPUT: Input data (HTTP)
    - Format: JSON 
    - Real-time constraints: TBD
    - Expected data volume? TBD
    The input data sources have to be further defined based on requirements.

OUTPUT 

1. OUTPUT: Output data (HTTP)
    - Format: JSON 
    - Real-time constraints: TBD
    - Expected data volume: TBD
    The output to other components have to be further defined based on requirments. 


The input data has to be further defined based on data sources and requirements. 

The output data and its ended end use (monitoring dashboard, simulation, OEE, etc.) have to be further defined
