## Adaptive Interfaces

Short name: ADIN

By TAU


### Purpose


This component enables the adaptation of interfaces depending on the information collected from production line devices and the userâ€™s profile, skills, and roles within the system.


### Data interfaces


Input and output data (but not user interfaces):

INPUT

1. INPUT: Decision Support level Input data, contect level input data
    - Format: TBD
    - Real-time constraints: TBD
    - Expected data volume? TBD
    
OUTPUT    

1. OUTPUT: Output data to mobile devices
    - Format: TBD
    - Real-time constraints: TBD
    - Expected data volume? TBD

2. OUTPUT: Output data to HMI dashboards
    - Format: HMI ...
    - Real-time constraints: TBD
    - Expected data volume? TBD
    The different HMI dashboard and their functionalities have to be further defined based on pilot requirements. 


The input data have to be further defined.

The output data have to be further defined in addition to possible interfaces to other components.
