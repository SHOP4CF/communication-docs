## Open-source implementation of 802.11 WIFI on FPGA

Short name: OpenWIFI

_Text in italics are comments. Please remove them._

### Purpose

This component provides low-latency wireless network connectivity (WiFi) and it thus only the transportation mechanism for data. It doesn't produce any data itself.

### Data interfaces

Input and output data (but not user interfaces): no data is used as input and no data is generated as output. It is an enabling component.

The component could possibly be used to provide low latency WiFi to support the AR cases in the Pilots. (exact components/pilot yet to be defined)
